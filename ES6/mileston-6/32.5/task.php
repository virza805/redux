/**
 * 1. let & const
 * 2. template string
 * 2.a: use variable
 * 2.b: use object property
 * 3. arrow function
 * 3.a: with one parameter. will return the number after dividing by 5
 * 3.b: with two parameters. will add tow to each number and then multiply the result.
 * 3.c: with three parameters. will multiply all three parameters
 * 3.d: with two parameters but it will be a multi line arrow function. will add two to each number and then multiply the result. make sure you return the result
 * 4. [Home work]: JavaScript function declaration vs arrow function
 * 5. array of numbers. and then map to get each elements multiplied by 5. must use arrow function
 * 6. [Challenging] numbers of array. get odd numbers by using filter with arrow function
 * 7. [Challenging] array of objects (E.g. products). use find to get the object with price 5000.
 * 8. You have an object. Now use destructing to create a simple variable of any property of the object.
 * 9. [Challenging] you have an array. Now use destructing to create a simple (or more) variable to get the third element of the array in a variable called 'three'.
 * 10. [Optional] just a write a function with three parameters and the last parameter will have a default parameter with value 7. this function will take three parameters and will return the sum of all the three parameters.
